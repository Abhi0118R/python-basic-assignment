        "# Python Basics Questions\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer :- Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use, making it popular for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, and automation. Its popularity stems from its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and ability to be easily learned by beginners.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer:-In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It translates the high-level Python code into machine-readable bytecode and then executes the bytecode, allowing for immediate results. This differs from compilers, which translate the entire code into machine code before execution.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in python\n",
        "   Answer:-Python keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and purposes in the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). They are essential for defining the syntax and structure of Python code. There are 35 keywords in Python 3.9. They are:\n",
        "[False, None, True, and, as, assert, async, await, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, and yield. ]\n",
        "\n",
        "     These keywords are used for various purposes such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Boolean logic: and, or, not\n",
        "     * Conditional statements: if, elif, else\n",
        "     * Loops: for, while, break, continue\n",
        "     * Functions: def, return, lambda\n",
        "     * Classes: class\n",
        "     * Exception handling: try, except, finally, raise, assert\n",
        "     * Modules and imports: import, from, as\n",
        "     * Context management: with\n",
        "     * Asynchronous programming: async, await\n",
        "     * Variable scope: global, nonlocal\n",
        "     * Other: in, is, pass, yield, del, None, True, False\n",
        "     # Note\n",
        "     It's important to note that all keywords except True, False, and None are in lowercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer:-No, keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "    # Note\n",
        "    Keywords are predefined identifiers that have special meanings within a programming language. They are used to construct the language's syntax and control program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Answer:-In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be modified after it's created. If an object is mutable, its state or value can be altered without creating a new object. Conversely, if an object is immutable, its state cannot be changed after creation. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object will instead result in the creation of a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer:-Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Answer:- == (equality operator): It checks if the values of two objects are the same. It compares the content of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "   is (identity operator): It checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. It compares the memory addresses of the objects.\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Answer:-Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify boolean expressions (True or False). There are three logical operators in Python: and, or, and not.\n",
        "  * and: Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise returns False.\n",
        "  * or: Returns True if at least one operand is True, otherwise returns False.\n",
        "  * not: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand. If the operand is True, it returns False, and vice versa.\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Answer:-Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. It is also known as type conversion. Type casting is useful when you need to perform operations on variables of different data types. There are two types of type casting in Python: implicit and explicit.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Answer:-Implicit and explicit type casting, also known as type conversion, are mechanisms for converting a value from one data type to another. Implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler, while explicit type casting requires the programmer to define the conversion using specific syntax.\n",
        "    * Implicit Type Casting (Widening):\n",
        "Definition: Automatic conversion of a smaller data type to a larger one.\n",
        "Example: Converting an integer (e.g., int) to a floating-point number (e.g., float).\n",
        "Purpose: Ensures compatibility when a smaller data type is assigned to a larger one or when different data types are combined in an expression.\n",
        "Safety: Generally safe as it doesn't lead to loss of data.\n",
        "    * Explicit Type Casting (Narrowing):\n",
        "Definition: Manual conversion of a larger data type to a smaller one.\n",
        "Example: Converting a floating-point number to an integer.\n",
        "Purpose: Provides control over the conversion process and can be used to prevent potential data loss or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "Syntax: Typically requires a cast operator (e.g., (int)value).\n",
        "Safety: Can lead to data loss or precision issues, especially when converting from a larger floating-point type to an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Answer:-Conditional statements in Python enable programs to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether specific conditions are met. They control the flow of execution, allowing for dynamic and responsive behavior. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.\n",
        "   * if statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.\n",
        "   * elif statement: An optional statement that allows checking multiple conditions sequentially. If the preceding if or elif condition is false, the elif condition is evaluated.\n",
        "   * else statement: An optional statement that provides a default block of code to execute if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "    \n",
        "   Answer:-The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Answer:-The primary difference between for and while loops lies in when the number of iterations is known beforehand. for loops are best suited for situations where you know exactly how many times the loop will execute, often when iterating over a collection or sequence. while loops, on the other hand, are more flexible and used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Answer:-In programming, for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help you iterate through your code.\n",
